Outliner
============

Quickly outline the shit out of some stuff!

You can try the current version here: http://outliner.setpixel.com/

Basically, it's for sequencing story ideas as quickly as possible. When you write a story, you can add a bunch of nodes or scenes to quickly outline the idea. Then you can use that as a scaffold when you write the full story/screenplay/document.

```
ENTER: add a node
TAB: change node type
Arrow up and down: change selection
COMMAND+ Arrow: change order
```

I'm writing this in all vanilla JS, trying not to use any backend code.
I'm using Google Drive Realtime API, and AWS SDK.
